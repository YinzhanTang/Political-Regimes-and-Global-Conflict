# Political Regimes and Global Conflict

Political regime is considered one of the most influential factors contributing to conflicts. For this matter, a commonly held belief is that democracy cause peace at least between democratic countries, while autocracy often leads to all kinds of conflicts due to aggressive diplomatic policies and political oppression. However, many researches showed that the impact of political regime on social stability is not that simple. This class project is a great opportunity for me to further examine the topic and draw my own conclusion. Although many researches have been done on this issue, I still think a visual perception of it is both interesting and valuable. 

Generally, I would study this issue by comparing the level of social and political stability (numbers and intensity of conflicts) of countries in different time periods when they have different democratic ratings and status.
