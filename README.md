# Political Regimes and Global Conflict

## 1. Background Introduction

Political regime is considered one of the most influential factors contributing to conflicts. For this matter, a commonly held belief is that democracy cause peace at least between democratic countries, while autocracy often leads to all kinds of conflicts due to aggressive diplomatic policies and political oppression. However, many evidence showed that the impact of political regime on social stability is not that simple. This class project is a great opportunity for me to further examine the topic and draw my own conclusion. Although many researches have been done on this issue, I still think a visual perception of it is both interesting and valuable. 

Generally, I would study this issue by comparing the level of social and political stability (numbers and intensity of conflicts) of countries in different time periods when they have different democratic ratings and status.

## 2. An Overview of World's Political Status

Simple data visualization techniques enables us to have an intutive sense of world's political status.

This graph shows that in 2017 there are more democratic countries (with postive Polity2 scores) tha autocratic countres (with negative Polity2 scores) in the world. Almost all autocratic countries concentrate in Asia and Africa. However, if ruling developed countries out of analysis, the democratic countries as a whole don't have better economic wellbeings than autocratic countries as expected. Some autocratic states have noticeable economic performance. China, which scores -7 in Polity2 Index, is the second-largest economy in the world and has a GDP per capita closed to $10000, almost 5 times the size of India, its democratic counterpart. Arabia States like Barlin, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have rich oil reserves, making them the world's most dictated states and richest states in the meantime.

This graph intuitively shows the evolution and development of political status in the past 217 years. In general, the world is becoming more and more democratic despite several recessions. The first modern democratic states were born in the industrial revolution. Along with the economic development, revolutions and reforms took place in many countries (especially in Europe), bring in constitution and elecotrial democracy. The number of democratic states continually increased until the Great War, after which many countries stepped back and gave dictators power because of the economy recession. During the Cold War, the world's democracy status deterioated again as Soviet Union expanded its influence. After the USSR collapsed in 1991, many countries democratized, resulting in a sharp incrase in world's average democracy status.

## 3. Political Schemes and Conflicts

This graph indicates that in general, after World War II, conflicts in autocratic areas significantly outnumber conflicts in democratic areas. However, it is also clear to see that  after Cold War (1991), democratic areas have higher conflict meganitudes than autocratic states. This is probably because newly democratized countries have unstable environment and need time before going back to the right track. Additionally, there is an increase in numbers of states in democratic areas, which might be another contributing fator.
